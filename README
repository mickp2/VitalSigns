This Android application is supposed to detect if the person is not moving. Typically this might happen in a medical emergency (No breathing or heat beat). This application works on an android  device (phones, tablets etc.) which have a 3 axis accelerometer. The application detects movements. If the movements are below a particular threshold than the application begins to beep and  a count down is initiated and finally the application begins to dial  and send out SMSes with the GPS co-ordinates to the numbers that are keyed into the settings.

While the application in its current form is restricted because it sends out the alert only after the fact(No breathing or heat beat).
